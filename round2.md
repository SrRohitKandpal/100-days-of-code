This is the new file which I'm making for taking the challenge second time. This solution is recommended to me by Alexander Kallaway himself.


# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

### I haven't forked this repo on October 11, 2017 but I really wanted to take another challenge as I'm not able to do all the things what I thought or planned. These last two and half a months of this year is really crucial for me. As I'm following freeCodeCamp and so many resources along with it but now I want to track record once again and to be "Front End Developer" at the end of this challenge.

### Day 1: October 11, 2017 - Day 26: November 6, 2017
##### (decided to take 100 days of code once again)

**Today's Progress**: I enrolled myself to edWisor too, it's an online bootcamp but of INDIA only. So I reached to assignment section of Level 2 - Front End Design and Responsive Web Design. Then for the rest of these 25 days I solved two problems of this assignment. First I created all 4 design patterns of Responsive Web Design. Then came the major problem "Responsive Portfolio". I finished both these tasks till 30th October then I made some changes too. And after that I moved to next Level 3 - jQuery. I learned from Video tutorials and also some resources over the internet. 

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to take the challenge again as I was not able to learn so many things in the first one. I wanted to be a Front End Developer as fast as I can, so as I'm following two major resources right now (freeCodeCamp and edWisor) to be Front End Dev I will track my record here too. I solved both these problems not with much difficulty, I used the same approach as always. Hope to update the log everyday from now and let's see how I will finish the year.

### Day 27: November 7,2017 - Day 57: December 6, 2017 

#### Again I was not able to update the log from last 28 days. I left my job exactly 33 days ago and decided to learn JS as much as I can to become a Front End Developer first then I'll learn Back End Development in JS too in #2018.

**Progress in this period**: I'm able to learn and finish so many things in between these days of absence and not updating the log. I have reached to Level-4 in edWisor portal. I have finished the Level-3 project 'jQuery- FB API Explorer' and submitted the code as github repo too. I got 45 marks out of 50 in it. I revised and learn more JavaScript from EJS book. I also finished a tutorial project which is on official angular's website https://angular.io/tutorial and forked the repo on github too. I finished the codeschool's JavaScript Road Trip Part 3 too. And in last two days I was able to finish one more tutorial 'Shaping Up with Angular' on codeschool. 

**Thoughts:** Our anxiety and frustration when gets mixed then we became disappointed. But these all negative things will not let over my passion now. I will be a Front End Developer very soon and sure I'll join one of the many companies with like minded people and learn more JS to become a Full Stack Developer in JS.
