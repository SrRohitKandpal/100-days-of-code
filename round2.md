# 100 Days Of Code - Round 2 Log

### I haven't forked this repo on October 11, 2017 but I really wanted to take another challenge as I'm not able to do all the things what I thought or planned. These last two and half a months of this year is really crucial for me. As I'm following freeCodeCamp and so many resources along with it but now I want to track record once again and to be "Front End Developer" at the end of this challenge.

### Day 1: October 11, 2017 - Day 26: November 6, 2017
##### (decided to take 100 days of code once again)

**Today's Progress**: I enrolled myself to edWisor too, it's an online bootcamp but of INDIA only. So I reached to assignment section of Level 2 - Front End Design and Responsive Web Design. Then for the rest of these 25 days I solved two problems of this assignment. First I created all 4 design patterns of Responsive Web Design. Then came the major problem "Responsive Portfolio". I finished both these tasks till 30th October then I made some changes too. And after that I moved to next Level 3 - jQuery. I learned from Video tutorials and also some resources over the internet. 

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to take the challenge again as I was not able to learn so many things in the first one. I wanted to be a Front End Developer as fast as I can, so as I'm following two major resources right now (freeCodeCamp and edWisor) to be Front End Dev I will track my record here too. I solved both these problems not with much difficulty, I used the same approach as always. Hope to update the log everyday from now and let's see how I will finish the year.
