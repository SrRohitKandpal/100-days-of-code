### Day 1: March 1, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I was working on second basic front end development project "Portfolio Page" from 3-4 days. Finally shared it on facebook and twitter. 

**Thoughts:** I feel really awesome after completing this project. Doing a private job from last 1.5 yrs., sometime I planned to make a portfolio but #fff gave me chance to that.
