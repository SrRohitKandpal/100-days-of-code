## Day 67: May 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Exercises time for Chapter-2. Today I have solved "Looping a Triangle" exercise of Eloquent Javascript book. I have also learnt little bit about Functions from learning area of JacaScript at MDN.

**Thoughts:** Concepts are easy to read but complex to apply at the staring stage of learning real programming.

## Day 68: May 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I have solved second exercise of Chapter-2, Eloquent Javascript book. This is one is real challenging as is is "FizzBuzz" challenge my friend.

**Thoughts:** FizzBuzz is a real exercise to the mind, what we have to print and which variables along with which conditions will write where to get appropriate result is challenging.

It's been 22 days I haaven'y updated this log. I was little busy in supplementary exams of my graduation. But still I managed to learn something new and build some new things which I will share tomorrow.

## Day 71 May 22, 2017 - Day 93 June 13 2017 

**Progress**: In between this period of time I able to finsh MDN's JS Building Blocks modules completely. I have also finshed Chapter-4 with all the exercises of Eloquent Javascript. I'm also able to finish two levels of JavaScript Road Trip Part 3 at codeschool.  

**Thoughts:** I witnessed that consistency is what a programmer think like a programmer. I will write a story at medium of my 100 Days of code challenge and I promise with new challenge of 100 Days of code I will conquer the Javascript and its major frameworks because that's what I really wanted this year #2017. Came back with new enthusiasm.

## Day 94 June 14 2017 - Day 100 June 21 2017   

I have done nothing much in the last 7 days of coding challenge. Overall saying this #100DaysOfChallenge has given me courage and determination that if I code daily just for 1 hour I'll be able to accomplish anything. Well these 100Days has been really very affective, I learn so many new things especially I learn how to beat myself everyday and come out from constraint.


I will begin new 100 Days of Challenge from 6th July 2017 and I promise this time I'm gonna digest whole JavaScript, JQuery, ES6, Angular and React.

Thank you very much Kallaway and thanks to everyone who helped in these 100 Days.
