# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I was working on second basic front end development project "Portfolio Page" from 3-4 days. Finally shared it on facebook and twitter. 

**Thoughts:** I feel really awesome after completing this project. Doing a private job from last 1.5 yrs., sometime I planned to make a portfolio but #fff gave me chance to that.

### Day 2: March 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I have completed the HTML-Profolio-Project of codeschool.com and pushed the code to github forked repository. 

**Thoughts:** I was thinking it was easy though it took five commits to complete the tasks. New to github, maybe it will improve soon. After all feeling satisfied. I can sleep well.
