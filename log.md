I have decided to teach Front End Development to two young kids of my locality. They both are young and struggling what to do in their life, so I just gave them an idea three months now they realize they have to learn something for themselves. My goal is to introduce them various aspects of design, coding and front end development. I pleadge that I will help them as much as I can and the rest depends on both of the. I will introduce them soon with freecodecamp community and other helpful resources.
